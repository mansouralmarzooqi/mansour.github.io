    <h2>about</h2>
    <p>
      High school student passionate about artificial intelligence and its real-world impact. I have studied at U.S. Embassy–affiliated schools in Paris and Abu Dhabi, and my work has focused on deep learning, computer vision, and medical AI. I've interned with the AI software team at Connecteve (a surgical robotics startup), participated in the NYU Summer Academy as a scholarship recipient sponsored by HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and built multiple models using PyTorch.
